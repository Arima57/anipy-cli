# Usage

## Install Dependencies

### Installers
All installers will install the python-libs so you can skip step 1. 

When you installed `anipy-cli` trough one of the installers you can execute `anipy-cli` from everywhere on your system.

Linux:

- `sudo make all` to install dependencies and anipy-cli
- `sudo make install` to install anipy-cli
- `sudo make uninstall` to uninstall anipy-cli

To run just do `anipy-cli` 

Windows: 

The windows installer is somewhat unstable so please open an issue when errors occur.

To install:
- Start a CMD session as administrator
- CD in the win folder of anipy-cli
- Type `win-installer.bat`
- It will now install python libs, create a bin folder in the root directory of anipy-cli that contains a anipy-cli.bat file and set a entry to the system path variable.
- Now open a new cmd (if you want color support get windows terminal from microsoft store) and type `anipy-cli`

To uninstall:
- Start a CMD session as administrator
- CD in the win folder of anipy-cli
- Type `win-uninstaller.bat`
- It will now delete the bin folder, but it will NOT delte the entry to the path variable, you should delete that yourself.

### 1. Python-Libs
To install `bs4`, `selenium`, `requests`, `webdriver-manager`, and `tqdm` open a terminal in the root-folder and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2. Other dependencies

Get Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Firefox, it's needed for Selenium, you can get it here: https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new or with the package manager of your linux Distro.

Get mpv from: https://mpv.io/installation/

Curl should be preinstalled on Windows, Linux and macOS if not get it from here: https://curl.se/download.html

## Start up 
To start `anipy-cli` do:

`python3 main.py`

or, if you are on Linux and did `sudo make all` or `sudo make install` do:

`anipy-cli` from everywhere on your system.


## Options
### Set video quality
`main.py -q "Your desired quality"`  or `anipy-cli -q "Your desired quality"` 

By default `ani-py-cli` tries to get the best quality avalible. You can spify a quality like so: `360/720/1080...` (without the "p" at the end)

You can also use  `best` or ` worst`.

### Download

`main.py -d` or `anipy-cli -d`

This will drop you in the download mode, from ther you can search an anime and download it. You can specify a range of episodes like so `1-4` or `4-20` etc.

### History
`main.py -H` or `anipy-cli -H`

This will let you pick one of your anime-episodes that you previously watched and resumes playback at the time you exited the video player.

### Delete History

`main.py -D` or `anipy-cli -D`

You can change your history.txt path in `config.py`

### Binge Mode

`main.py -b` or `anipy-cli -b`

Specify a range of episodes and play them back to back.

### Seasonal Anime Mode

`main.py -s` or `anipy-cli -s`

Binge-watch or bulk-download the newest episodes of animes.

You can change your seasonals.txt path in `config.py`

### Config File
Change `config.py` if you want any of the options given there changed.

# Features

### Big range of Modes

- Download
- Binge
- Seasonal

### Resume Playback
#### The Resume playback function counts the seconds after the video player is opened and stops when its closed (does not stop when you pause the video). It stores the value and uses it when `-H` is called, not when you just play a episode like normal. When you play a episode from History, it will continue to count and adds it to the existing value.    

### Menu
#### Has a menu that pops up after you picked an episode to play, there yopu can either play next episode, play previous episode, replay episode, open history selection, search for another anime or quit.
