# Usage

## Install Dependencies
### Geckodriver
Geckodriver is the render engine of firefox, it is needed for selenium. 

Installation:

Windows: The `geckodriver.exe` executeable is already in the repo, but it is always smart to get the newest realese, for this go to: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Linux: On Arch-Based system the package `geckodriver` is already in the Community-Repo and can be installed like so: `sudo pacman -S geckodriver`. On Debian-Systems the installation is harder:

- Go to https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases and download the latest .tar.gz file for your system.
- Extract the file to any folder with `tar -xvzf geckodriver*`
- Make it executable with `chmod +x geckodriver`
- Add it to the PATH like so: `export PATH=$PATH:/path-to-extracted-file/`

### Other dependencies
Get Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Get mpv from: https://mpv.io/installation/

Curl should be preinstalled on Windows, Linux and macOS if not get it from here: https://curl.se/download.html

### Python-Libs

To install `bs4`, `selenium` and `requests` open a terminal in the root-folder and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Start up 
To start `anipy-cli` do:

`pyton main.py`

## Options
### Set video quality
`main.py -q "Your desired quality"` 

By default `ani-py-cli` tries to get the best quality avalible. You can spify a quality like so: `360/720/1080...` (without the "p" at the end)

You can also use  `best` or ` worst`.

### History
`main.py -H`

This will let you pick one of your anime-episodes that you previously watched and resumes playback at the time you exited the video player.


### Delete History

`main.py -D`

# Features
### Resume Playback
#### The Resume playback function counts the seconds after the video player is opened and stops when its closed (does not stop when you pause the video). It stores the value and uses it when `-H` is called, not when you just play a episode like normal. When you play a episode from History, it will continue to count and adds it to the existing value.    

### Menu
#### Has a menu that pops up after you picked an episode to play, there yopu can either play next episode, play previous episode, replay episode, open history selection, search for another anime or quit.
